# A simple to do app

This to do app is based on CodingNepal's example.

Additions that I added besides some styling include:

- added today's date
- putting the input field in focus when selecting edit
- changed the Clear All button to Clear Done: clicking the button will only delete tasks have been checked off.
- after a change is made (Edit or Delete), the showToDo function will show the tasks in the current filtered view, instead of always reverting to showing All tasks
